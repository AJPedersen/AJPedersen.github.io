The other day I challenged a friend to a streak off. You see I really enjoy the fresh air on my skin, that feeling of freedom, of pushing the boundaries. When I get on a really good streak, you know, fingers streaming over that keyboard, going all out, it just feels *good*. Especially when I solve a particularly tough problem that I have been puzzling over for a few days. The kind of streak I am talking about is a GitHub streak, what were you thinking?  

GitHub keeps track of how many days in a row that you have pushed code to a repository. When you are pushing code to a repository you are working, solving problems, creating. I love to create. Sometimes I get off track, or forget, or just get lazy and don't push code, don't create. Sometimes I need a little extra motivation.  

### The Streak Off

To create some competition and motivation I challenged a few friends to a GitHub streak off. The rules are:  

- Commit everyday to maintain your streak.
- Push meaningful code/content (code, blog post, something constructive)
- Be honest!  

The first one to lose their streak loses, the winner gets a prize, determined beforehand.  

And that is the streak off! May the odds be forever in your favor!
