Web development is moving. Whether it's a new framework or a new language, there is always something to learn. In addition to [Code Academy](http://codeacademy.com), [Code School](http://codeschool.com), [Team Tree House](http://teamtreehouse.com), I have found a few good sites lately that I have been using to keep up to date. Here they are:

- [Code Wars](http://www.codewars.com/) is a good place to practice code [kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata).
- [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/#) Sharpen your CSS selector skills.
- [Typing Club](https://www.typingclub.com/) Learn to type properly or practice.
- [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) One of the best books on Javascript out there-free!
- [Human-Centered Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/human-computer-interaction) Learn UX design.

There are a ton of resources out there, it takes time to find the gems in though. Take a look at these and see if they work for you.
