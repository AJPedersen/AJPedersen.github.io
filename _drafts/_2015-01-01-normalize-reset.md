Web browsers all fall back to their standard configuration if they cannot, for whatever reason, load the provided stylesheet.css. To get around this someone made a default reset.css stylesheet that sets the browser defaults to a more consistent set, instead of falling back on multiple defaults depending on the browser. This is a good solution to the problem, but there is a better one; Normalize.css!
