I have been a passionate user of open source software for years. Here's some of the open source software that I like and use:

- [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)
- [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
- [Linux](http://distrowatch.com/) in many of it's flavors, namely Mint, Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Puppy Linux, Nas4Free, Tails, and a few more.
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) Check out my wife's [blog!](http://www.liesllove.com/) Built with WordPress.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/) for the browsering.
- [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) I use this one for the internets.
- [Audacity](http://audacityteam.org/) for audio editing.
- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) for image editing. Also memes.
- [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) for compressing/uncompressing files.
- [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) for managing and converting ebooks.  

And a lot more! I love the ethos of open source; give, contribute, help others. As I learn more web development I have been more and more interested in contributing to open source software. Since I am still learning I have been trying to contribute in whatever way I can. The main way that I have found to do this is through translating Spanish. The best medium that I have found to do this is through [TranslateWiki](https://translatewiki.net/), which is a: 

> Localisation platform for translation communities, language communities, and free and open source projects. It started out with localisation for MediaWiki. Later support was added for MediaWiki extensions, FreeCol and other free and open source projects.  

This has been an easy way for me to start contributing towards open source projects in a way that is meaningful and important. I believe that it is important to contribute in any way you can. Here are a few resources that have inspired me to get into open source:  

- [CodeMontage](http://codemontage.com/)
- [CodeTriage](http://www.codetriage.com/)
- [Issue Hub](http://issuehub.io/)
- [Contribute Hub](http://contribhub.org/)  

In addition to coding you can help out by translating, writing documentation, testing, or just giving constructive criticism. Just get involved in any way you can! Give back and help your community.
