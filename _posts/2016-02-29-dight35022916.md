###PHP calendar


1. `MKTIME()`
    - Get Unix timestamp for a date.
    - Timestamp is a long integer conaining the number of seconds btwn the Unix Epoch (Jan 1 1970) and time specified.
    - Looks like: `mktime($hour,$minute,$second,$month,$day,$year);` -> generates time right now.

This works really well when you pair it with:

2. `DATE($FORMAT, $TIMESTAMP`)
    - Format a local time/date.
    - Some examples:


L = Is it a leap year?

Y = A full numeric representation of a year, 4 digits

n = Numeric representation of a month, without leading zeros

F = A full textual representation of a month, such as January or March

t = Number of days in the given month

w = Numeric representation of the day of the week

j = Day of the month without leading zeros
