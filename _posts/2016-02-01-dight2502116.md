###FTP


To upload site files (html, css) to a server so that it can be a real, grown up, website you have to use a FTP client. 


FTP stands for _F_ile _T_ransfer _P_protocol and does what it says; transfers files-moves a file from your computer to a server.


On PC and Mac there are a few good free options. These include:


1. [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/?l=en)
2. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)


Go download one of these and play with it.

###CSS selectors


Use [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) to practice your CSS selectors! It's lots of fun!

`class` = `.`

For example if I had an html element with the `class = "stuff"` I would use `.stuff` in my CSS to select that element to style.

`id` = `#`

For example if I had an html element with the `id = "thing"` I would use `#thing` in my CSS to select that element to style.

Now go and play on [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/). Do them all! All the things! Do all the CSS!

Try reading your CSS from right to left in order to understand it better.
