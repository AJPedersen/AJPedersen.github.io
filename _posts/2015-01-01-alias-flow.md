title: Using aliases for flow
permalink: alias-flow

In addition to adding a function to CD to my project folders quicker I added a few aliases to my bash_profile. An alias is nothing more than a shortcut. These are the ones that I added:

`alias ga='git add .'`
`alias gc='git commit -m' # requires you to type a commit messagee`
`alias gp='git push'`

They allow me to `git add, git commit, git push` by typing two characters. When you do this multiple times a day (the other day I made 24 commits in the space of about two hours) these shortcuts really help stay in the flow and focus on code, not typing repetitive commands.
