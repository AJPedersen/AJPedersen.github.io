###Flexbox

Defines elements as a 'flex' container and it's children as flex items.

1. `flex-grow`
    - How much space item takes in relation to it's siblings. 
    - Usually a number, i.e. `1` they would all take up same size, `2` would take twice as much room up.
2. `flex-direction`
    - Which direction to flow layout.
    - `row` is default-L to R, `row-reverse`, `column` vertical-top to bottom, `column-reverse`.
3. `justify-content`
    - How space is distributed along the main axis-up and down ^^ \/\/.
    - `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`.
4. `align-items`
    - How space is distributed perpendicular to the main axis (on the cross axis-left to right <- - ->).
    - `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`, `stretch` allows equal height columns, default.
5. `flex-wrap`
    - Force a single line or allow wrapping. Way to tell items if they should stay on single line or wrap to new one, useful with `min-size`.
    - `nowrap`, `wrap`, `wrap-reverse`
6. `align-content`
    - Aligns content rows along cross axis when there is space.
    - `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `stretch`.
7. `align-self`
    - Override for default `align-items` allows you to target individual items.
    - `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`, `stretch`.
