There are a lot of resources out there to learn web development. One of the best, newest, and hottest right now is [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/). They are an open source community driven platform to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a lot more. I have been a 'camper' for a while and have learned a lot from FCC. If you are interested in learning to code, don't have a ton of money or time to learn, then FCC is your best bet.
