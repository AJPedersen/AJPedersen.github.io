Today I learned something amazing. This amazing thing is the `CD -` ! When you are navigating between your files in the terminal sometimes you need to switch between two different directories. Normally you would need to type something like this to get to the folder you want:  
`cd ~/my awesome web stuff/project awesome sauce/sriracha`  

And then when you need to get back to your previous folder or get to another folder - say where your awesome scripts live - you would need to type something like:  

`cd ~/my awesome web stuff/project awesome sauce/scripticles`  

That gets tiresome. All that typing on my sensitive wrists. The horror. Instead, after you get into your second folder all you have to do to get back to your first folder is:  

`cd -`  

And voila! You are back in your first folder. This is amazing. I loves it.
