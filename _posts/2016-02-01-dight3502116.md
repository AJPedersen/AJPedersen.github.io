###Joins Part II


Create your simple tables first, then make more complex tables. This is because:


1. Establishing `KEYS` relationships is easier this way.
2. Start with the small pieces - easier to organize.


####JOINS


Step one:

`JOIN` alchemy_formulas >> formula_elements

then

`JOIN` alchemy_formulas » formula_ingredients » alchemy_ingredients

---

`UNIQUE` constraint = Only one of the value in table.


Different from `PRIMARY KEY`; only one `PRIMARY KEY` in whole table.


`UNIQUE` can be used multiple times in the table.


`CONSTRAINT` name has to be unique name, system will generate a name if you don't put one in.


`AS` creates an alias for your table name, whatever you specify after `AS`.


####Additional constraints

Additional ways to change queries.

`CHECK (criteria)` 


`CHECK (element <> 'fire')`  <> means &ne; (does not equal)


`HAVING aggregate_function(field) operator value` 


`WHERE field IN()`


`WHERE field NOT IN()`


`WHERE element IN ('air', 'water', 'earth')` 


`WHERE element NOT IN ('heart', 'fire')`


####Sub queries

Anywhere you could put a () you could use a sub query. Cleans up your query. MySQL executes sub query first. Works well with aggregates. Helps out a bunch, at least understand what they are doing.


`SELECT * FROM Books WHERE cost > (SELECT AVG(cost) FROM Books)`
