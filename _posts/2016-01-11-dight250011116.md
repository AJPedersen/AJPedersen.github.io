##Building a website continued  

Take what we learned last week and make a skeleton HTML page. Do it, do it now!  
Here are the basic tags you should use, remember to close them:  

- `<!doctype html>`  
- `<html>`  
- `<head>`  
- `<meta>`  
- `<title>`  
- `<body>`  

###Adding images  

`<img src="" alt="" />` This is a self closing tag, hence the '/'.  
- `src` = Path to image  
- `alt` = Alternate text for image, important for _accessibility_-required for our class. Alt text is also how most search engines find images, so important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization-making your site show up on search engines closer to the top of the results).

###File path basics


Directions to the file from the HTML:

Same folder = `fileName`

Into a sub-folder (down a level) = `foldername/fileName`

Out of a sub-folder (up a level) = `../fileName`

So if I had a .JPG picture that I wanted to put on my website, and the file was named 'catpic.JPG', and it was stored in my home/documents/website/assets/ folder, then my HTML image tag would be:


`<img src="home/documents/website/assets/catpic.JPG" alt="Awesome picture of my cat" />`



###Images

There are a few types of images that we can use:



GIF = Simple blocks of color, limited transparency. Look at this [gif](http://www.nyan.cat/ here!)

JPG/JPEG = Complexity of color, no transparency.

PNG = Complexity of color, full transparency.

For the web you generally want a smaller image size, you would never just pull a raw image off a camera and put it up. You want to use around 72dpi (dots per inch) resolution for the web.


###Making a site


`%hellip` = '...'


###Why the web is exciting as a medium


Interconnectivity! Hypertext links, i.e. LINKS!

`<a href="www.this-is-a-link.com">Linked text</a>`


href = hypertext transfer protocol


Similar to linking to an image, except you are pointing to another page on the interwebs, not an image stored in a folder. Unless you _are_ linking to a page on your own site. So if I have two pages on my site, named index.html and aboutme.html, to link to my aboutme.html page my tag would look like this:


`<a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a>`


This assumes that both index.html and aboutme.html are stored in the same folder, if not then you would use the same guidelines as linking to an image. 


If you were to link to an outside website your tag would look like this:


`<a href="http://www.nyan.cat">Cat.</a>`
