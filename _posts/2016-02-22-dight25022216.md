###Native audio and video

####<audio>

Embedded audio on your pages.


1. `controls`
    - Put it there or not; yes/no toggle to display any controls. Basic controls available now.
    - Without this people cannot control anything, so use it.
2. `autoplay`
    - Don't do this, makes audio play automatically.
3. `src`
    - Source, filepath to audio.
4. `type`
    - Kinda limited, can play still .wav files though. Typically audio/mp3.


####<video>

Embedded video on your pages.


1. `controls`
    - Put it there or not; yes/no toggle to display any controls. Basic controls available now.
    - Without this people cannot control anything, so use it.
    - Possibly possible to dig into it and control which controls display.
2. `autoplay`
    - Don't do this, makes video play automatically.
3. `muted`
    - Plays video muted. Could do this for a video background.
4. `poster`

    - video/mp4
    - video/ogg
2. `src`

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.850
but the ancient Gods of Olympus are angry

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and threaten a terrible revenge.
```

ma gli antichi Dei dell'Olimpo sono arrabbiati

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
e minacciano una terribile vendetta.
```
