##PHP

>A widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.


Integrates seamlessly, can do all the cool things like:


1. Server side scripting
    - Forms
2. Generate page content


####What do I need?


Server, browser, and PHP parser.


MAMP/LAMP will allow you to run PHP in your local environment. Otherwise you need to run it from a server.


####Some stuffs:


Basic PHPness:

1. Includes
```<? 
    include ("includes/header.php");
    ?>
```
2. Variables
```
$title = "Item inventory";
```

```
<?php echo date ("Y"); ?>
```

Gives you the date, `Y` = 4 digit year
3. URLs
- Get string:
- 
```
?section=foodstuffs
```

4. Programming Logic
`if` true then run whatever is inside the braces, otherwise skip braces:
```
if( isset ($_GET["section"]){
        
        $title = $_GET["section"];
    }
```

`$` = variable
`_GET` = references following variable

But this allows anyone to edit the page by editing the URL - User input = bad in this case. We want to nest another `if` statement like so:

```
    if( isset($_GET["section"]){
        if( $_GET["section"]== "foodstuffs"){

        $title = $_GET["section"];

    }
}
```

Returns literal, so url has to be "foodstuffs", cannot be "Foodstuffs". But you can fis this with `strtolower` which will make all url input lower case.

Use `endif;` and `:` instead of closing braces like so:
```
if( isset($_GET["section"]):
        if( strtolower($_GET["section"]== "foodstuffs"):

        $title = $_GET["section"];

     elseif($_GET["section"]== "potions") :
        $title = "potions";

    endif;
endif;
```

5. Arrays
```
$suggestions = array(
        "Magical Book",
        "Cheese",
        "Torch"

    );
```
6. Loops
```
foreach ($suggestions as $item):
                        echo '<li>' . $item . '<li>';
                    endforeach;
```

7. Functions
8. Comments
```
// comment

# Also a comment

/* this is a comment on
multiple
linex
*/
```


Check error_log if PHP is not working right.
