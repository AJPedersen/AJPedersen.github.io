##What do I need to make a website?  

Text editor  
	- BBedit, (Sublime Text)[https://www.sublimetext.com/], (Atom)[https://atom.io/].  

Browser  
	-Chrome is the official class browser. Dont use Internet Explorer, just do not do it. Firefox is good too.  

##Syntax  

`<tag attribute="value">` = opening tag  
Next comes the actual content. So:  

```
<tag attribute="value">  
	Content for my awesome blog blahblahblah. I like cheese.  
</tag>
```
This is called an element. HTML documents end in `.html` and HAVE TO begin with `<!DOCTYPE>`

Browsers ignore whitespace.
