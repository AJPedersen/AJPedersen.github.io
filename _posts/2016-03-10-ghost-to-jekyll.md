**TL;DR** Just graduated, learning to code, polishing all the things.

I just graduated! After school being the primary focus of my life for the past 6 years, it is quite an adjustement to be done. 

Now I am focusing on learning JavaScript in depth with [World Tech Academy](http://www.worldtechacademy.com), polishing my resume and portfolio, and blogging about it all. 

I have updated my portfolio/blog using a free Jekyll [theme](https://github.com/getmicah/getmicah.github.io) as a template.
