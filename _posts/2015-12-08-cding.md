When I work on my projects I use [GitHub](http://github.com) for all of my version control. It's an awesome place to keep and collaborate on code. The process of updating and maintaining my code becomes monotonous, especially when you add navigating to my project folders through the terminal. After a couple of days of this I got fed up and decided that there had to be a better day. After all, developers are known for being lazy-we have to automate everything.

I use the terminal on OSX so I edited my bash_profile file to include a couple of functions. You could do the same thing with aliases or by editing your bashrc file. Adding a function to my bash_profile worked the best for me, your mileage may vary. On OSX your .bash_profile is located in your root directory. One way to get into this file/create it is with the touch command. The touch command creates a file without you having to edit it. It's also used to update the access/modify date of a file. Anyways, to get to or create your bash_profile and open it use:

`touch ~/.bash_profile; open ~/.bash_profile`  

This will open your bash_profile with whatever default text editor is set in your system. In order to CD to my project folders I added a few functions like so:  

`function cdsaw() {  

cd ~/web_dev/projects/obscure all the things/folder/long path name/Super Awesome Website  

}`  

Now when I want to get into my GitHub project folders all I have to type is `cdsaw` to get there. It makes my workflow that much faster.
