When I work on my projects I use [GitHub](http://github.com) for all of my version control. It's an awesome place to keep and collaborate on code. The process of updating and maintaining my code becomes monotonous, especially when you add navigating to my project folders through the terminal. After a couple of days of this I got fed up and decided that there had to be a better day. After all, developers are known for being lazy-we have to automate everything.
