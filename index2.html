	<p>For this assignment I went on a trip of <i>discovery</i> at <a href="http://www.codepen.io" target="_blank">Codepen</a>. I chose several pens and combined them or edited them to work with my ideas.</p>

	<p>For the preloader screen I used two parts:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://ihatetomatoes.net/create-custom-preloading-screen/" target="_blank">This</a> tutorial to create a preloading page</li>
			<li><a href="http://codepen.io/xposedbones/pen/aOrQVy" target="_blank">This</a> pen of an awesome spinney animation</li>
			<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/">This</a> tutorial to get my background image to behave</li>
		</ul>

	<p>
	I had to combine them and tinker with the setup quite a bit. It took me about two hours to do this part alone.
	</p>

	<p>For the background I combined these:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://codepen.io/supah/pen/RrzREx" target="_blank">This</a> pen for the background mouse effect</li>
			<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/">This</a> tutorial to get my background image to behave better</li>
		</ul>

	<p>This was relatively straightforward, but did take some tweaking to get right. It took me about 20 minutes to get this right.</p>

	<p>For the about page image flipper I found <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/demo/css-flip.php">this</a> tutorial. This was easy and I was able to tweak it and get it to work in about 15 minutes.</p>

	<p>Since I was feeling spastic I used <a href="https://codepen.io/dudleystorey/pen/ehKpi">this</a> pen for the image slider on the about page. Click on one, you may be surprised by what you find!</p>
