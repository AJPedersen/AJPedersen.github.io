AlexJP.com portfolio site.

This is my personal portfolio website-a business card on the web. I created this with HTML and CSS as a place to track and show off my journey to web development. As I learn more this site will change and grow. I plan on adding a blog made with Jekyll, incorporating JavaScript as I learn more, and hopefully linking to all the cool apps and projects I create.

I used this tutorial http://www.curtismlarson.com/blog/2015/04/12/github-pages-google-domains/ to redirect my domain to my github page. I really like Google domains since they provide private WHOIS service in the price of the domain, which was an affordable $12!

This http://sixrevisions.com/css/css-tips/css-tip-1-resetting-your-styles-with-css-reset/ explanation of reset.css really helped me understand why and how to use a reset.css file. In my use case I will use a separate reset.css file called before my stylesheet.css. For some reason Eric Meyer's reset.css did not work for me; it messed up my margins and padding. Most likely this is because I did not take the time to edit it for my use case. I actually ended up using normalize.css, check it out -> http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/
