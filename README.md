AlexJP.com portfolio site.

This is my personal portfolio website. A business card on the web, essentially. I created this with HTML and CSS as a place to track and show off my journey to web development. As I learn more this site will change and grow. I plan on adding a blog made with Jekyll, incorporating JavaScript as I learn more, and hopefully linking to all the cool apps and projects I create.
