This is my professional blog and project showcase. Built with Jekyll and using a super awesome theme called [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/).  

I am a father, husband, and developer based in Provo, UT. I enjoy contributing to open source software and learning more about web technologies. I am also very interested in Latin America and regularly do Spanish translation for open source projects through TranslateWiki.
